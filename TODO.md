[x] Start trying to extract the network
[x] Extract all unique cells to individual gds and svg using a makefile
[x] Work out coordinate system of the file
[x] Work out how to filter on global coords rather than local - maybe flatten all top cells, and do it by bounding box?
[x] Turn this into a proper repo on my github
[x] Create a realtime-updating svg viewer? - No, not needed. Chrome does a good-enough job
[ ] Find a local GDS viewer - could I use Raylib + voxels? Probably not a good idea but ....
  [x] Start gds viewer in raylib - steal an example
  [x] Fix orthographic view in examples - relies on rcamera and possibly rmath, can probably copy-paste
  [x] Draw up my understanding of raylib camera perspectives (first/third person, orthographic) in xcalidraw
[ ] Try to understand individual cells
  [x] Look at circuit elements made by cells.py
  [x] Work out how to show labels (maybe convert to text?) and add them to cells.py - Was done already in svg function
  [ ] Look at obscured labels under PWR and GND labels
  [ ] Read the manual - https://sky130-unofficial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[ ] Draw up my understanding of gds in xcalidraw
[ ] Try to find a single example of a circuit element connected to a wire and write it to a gds
[ ] What are boundaries?
[ ] Why does the text file have more types?
